1. Deleting the partition
   1.1 Open Disk Management to figure out all the partitions that are realated to linus.
   1.2 Type Win + X and tap on "d", which will eventually open the Diskmanagement.
   1.3 Identify the linux partitions, delete them. Make sure that any recovery or system
       partition(s) are not deleted.
   1.4 Extend the windows partition to occupy is the free space is not needed. If you want
       to dual boot then keep the space unallocated to perform the dual boot.
2. Removing the boot entry from EFI partition.
   2.1 Remove the UEFI entry for linux.
       2.1.1 Open Command Prompt in Administrative mode.
       2.1.2 Type "bcdedit /enum all" to view all boot related entries.
       2.1.3 Copy and paste the UUID of the linux distribution entry ("Right Click" to copy
             the UUID).
       2.1.4 type "bcdedit /delete {UUID}"
   2.2 Remove the boot files for linux.
       2.2.1 Find the EFI partition containg Linux Installation.
       2.2.2 Inside the command prompt(Administrator), type:
             "diskpart" -> This will open the diskpartition prompt.
             "list disk" -> This will show the disk
             "sel disk <number>" -> using this select the disk in which linux is installed.
             "list vol" -> To show the volumes of the corresponding disk.
             "sel vol <X> -> Select the volume in which linux boot files are present.
                             (Replace X with the FAT32 EFI system partition volume number)
             "assign letter=Y:" -> assigns the partition the letter Y and pops it in "The Pc".
                                   (as usual drives)
             "exit" -> to exit from the diskpartition prompt.
               
       2.2.3 Being in Administrative mode type:
             "cd /d Y:" -> To change to directory Y:\>
             "cd EFI" -> To change to EFI directory
             # Note : If "No such directory exists" appears then simply close the command
               prompt # No need to Proceed Furthur :) else follow the steps below.
             "rmdir /S <name_of_linux_distro>
             
                    
       The step 2.2.3 can also be done in one line by typing:
             "rmdir /S Y:\EFI\<Name_of_Linux_Distro>" -> This deletes the directory Y:\EFI\<Name_of_Linux_Distro>                                                  

3. Done!!! Enjoy installing new Linux distros!!! :):):)
